The `ngx_http_secure_link_module` module (0.7.18)
is used to check authenticity of requested links,
protect resources from unauthorized access,
and limit link lifetime.

The authenticity of a requested link is verified by comparing the
checksum value passed in a request with the value computed
for the request.
If a link has a limited lifetime and the time has expired,
the link is considered outdated.
The status of these checks is made available in the
`$secure_link` variable.

The module provides two alternative operation modes.
The first mode is enabled by the [](#secure_link_secret)
directive and is used to check authenticity of requested links
as well as protect resources from unauthorized access.
The second mode (0.8.50) is enabled by the
[](#secure_link) and [](#secure_link_md5)
directives and is also used to limit lifetime of links.

This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the
`--with-http_secure_link_module`
configuration parameter.
## Directives

### secure_link

{{< call-out >}}

**Syntax:** secure_link `expression`

**Default:** -

**Context:** http, server, location


{{</call-out>}}


Defines a string with variables from which the
checksum value and lifetime of a link will be extracted.

Variables used in an `expression` are usually associated
with a request; see [example](#secure_link_md5) below.

The checksum value extracted from the string is compared with
the MD5 hash value of the expression defined by the
[](#secure_link_md5) directive.
If the checksums are different, the `$secure_link` variable
is set to an empty string.
If the checksums are the same, the link lifetime is checked.
If the link has a limited lifetime and the time has expired,
the `$secure_link` variable is set to ‚Äú`0`‚Äù.
Otherwise, it is set to ‚Äú`1`‚Äù.
The MD5 hash value passed in a request is encoded in
[base64url](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5).

If a link has a limited lifetime, the expiration time
is set in seconds since Epoch (Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT).
The value is specified in the expression after the MD5 hash,
and is separated by a comma.
The expiration time passed in a request is available through
the `$secure_link_expires` variable for a use in
the [](#secure_link_md5) directive.
If the expiration time is not specified, a link has the unlimited
lifetime.
### secure_link_md5

{{< call-out >}}

**Syntax:** secure_link_md5 `expression`

**Default:** -

**Context:** http, server, location


{{</call-out>}}


Defines an expression for which the MD5 hash value will
be computed and compared with the value passed in a request.

The expression should contain the secured part of a link (resource)
and a secret ingredient.
If the link has a limited lifetime,
the expression should also contain `$secure_link_expires`.

To prevent unauthorized access, the expression may contain some
information about the client, such as its address and browser version.

Example:

```nginx
location /s/ {
    secure_link $arg_md5,$arg_expires;
    secure_link_md5 "$secure_link_expires$uri$remote_addr secret";

    if ($secure_link = "") {
        return 403;
    }

    if ($secure_link = "0") {
        return 410;
    }

    ...
}

```


The
‚Äú`/s/link?md5=_e4Nc3iduzkWRm01TBBNYw&expires=2147483647`‚Äù
link
restricts access to ‚Äú`/s/link`‚Äù for the client with the
IP address 127.0.0.1.
The link also has the limited lifetime until January 19, 2038 (GMT).

On UNIX, the `md5` request argument value can be obtained as:

```nginx
echo -n '2147483647/s/link127.0.0.1 secret' | \
    openssl md5 -binary | openssl base64 | tr +/ -_ | tr -d =

```

### secure_link_secret

{{< call-out >}}

**Syntax:** secure_link_secret `word`

**Default:** -

**Context:** location


{{</call-out>}}


Defines a secret `word` used to check authenticity
of requested links.

The full URI of a requested link looks as follows:

```nginx
/`prefix`/`hash`/`link`
```


where `hash` is a hexadecimal representation of the
MD5 hash computed for the concatenation of the link and secret word,
and `prefix` is an arbitrary string without slashes.

If the requested link passes the authenticity check,
the `$secure_link` variable is set to the link
extracted from the request URI.
Otherwise, the `$secure_link` variable
is set to an empty string.

Example:

```nginx
location /p/ {
    secure_link_secret secret;

    if ($secure_link = "") {
        return 403;
    }

    rewrite ^ /secure/$secure_link;
}

location /secure/ {
    internal;
}

```


A request of ‚Äú`/p/5e814704a28d9bc1914ff19fa0c4a00a/link`‚Äù
will be internally redirected to
‚Äú`/secure/link`‚Äù.

On UNIX, the hash value for this example can be obtained as:

```nginx
echo -n 'linksecret' | openssl md5 -hex

```

## Embedded Variables

`$secure_link`
The status of a link check.
The specific value depends on the selected operation mode.
`$secure_link_expires`
The lifetime of a link passed in a request;
intended to be used only in the
[](#secure_link_md5) directive.
