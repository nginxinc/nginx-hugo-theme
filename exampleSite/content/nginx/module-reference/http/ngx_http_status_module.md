The `ngx_http_status_module` module provides
access to various status information.

This module was available as part of our
commercial subscription
until 1.13.10.
It was superseded by the
[ngx_http_api_module](/nginx/module-reference/http/ngx_http_api_module) module
in 1.13.3.
## Example Configuration


```nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        zone http_backend 64k;

        server backend1.example.com weight=5;
        server backend2.example.com;
    }

    proxy_cache_path /data/nginx/cache_backend keys_zone=cache_backend:10m;

    server {
        server_name backend.example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass  http://backend;
            proxy_cache cache_backend;

            health_check;
        }

        status_zone server_backend;
    }

    server {
        listen 127.0.0.1;

        location /upstream_conf {
            upstream_conf;
        }

        location /status {
            status;
        }

        location = /status.html {
        }
    }
}

stream {
    upstream backend {
        zone stream_backend 64k;

        server backend1.example.com:12345 weight=5;
        server backend2.example.com:12345;
    }

    server {
        listen      127.0.0.1:12345;
        proxy_pass  backend;
        status_zone server_backend;
        health_check;
    }
}

```


Examples of status requests with this configuration:

```nginx
http://127.0.0.1/status
http://127.0.0.1/status/nginx_version
http://127.0.0.1/status/caches/cache_backend
http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams
http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams/backend
http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams/backend/peers/1
http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams/backend/peers/1/weight
http://127.0.0.1/status/stream
http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams
http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams/backend
http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams/backend/peers/1
http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams/backend/peers/1/weight

```


The simple monitoring page is shipped with this distribution,
accessible as ‚Äú`/status.html`‚Äù in the default configuration.
It requires the locations ‚Äú`/status`‚Äù and
‚Äú`/status.html`‚Äù to be configured as shown above.
## Directives

### status

{{< call-out >}}

**Syntax:** status 

**Default:** -

**Context:** location


{{</call-out>}}


The status information will be accessible from the surrounding location.
Access to this location should be
[limited](/nginx/module-reference/http/ngx_http_core_module#satisfy).
### status_format

{{< call-out >}}

**Syntax:** status_format `json`

**Syntax:** status_format `jsonp` [ `callback` ]

**Default:** json

**Context:** http, server, location


{{</call-out>}}


By default, status information is output in the JSON format.

Alternatively, data may be output as JSONP.
The `callback` parameter specifies the name of a callback function.
Parameter value can contain variables.
If parameter is omitted, or the computed value is an empty string,
then ‚Äú`ngx_status_jsonp_callback`‚Äù is used.
### status_zone

{{< call-out >}}

**Syntax:** status_zone `zone`

**Default:** -

**Context:** server


{{</call-out>}}
