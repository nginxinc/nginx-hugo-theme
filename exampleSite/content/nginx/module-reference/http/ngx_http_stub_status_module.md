The `ngx_http_stub_status_module` module provides
access to basic status information.

This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the
`--with-http_stub_status_module`
configuration parameter.
## Example Configuration


```nginx
location = /basic_status {
    stub_status;
}

```


This configuration creates a simple web page
with basic status data which may look like as follows:

```nginx
Active connections: 291
server accepts handled requests
 16630948 16630948 31070465
Reading: 6 Writing: 179 Waiting: 106

```

## Directives

### stub_status

{{< call-out >}}

**Syntax:** stub_status 

**Default:** -

**Context:** server, location


{{</call-out>}}


The basic status information will be accessible from the surrounding location.

In versions prior to 1.7.5,
the directive syntax required an arbitrary argument, for example,
‚Äú`stub_status on`‚Äù.
## Data


The following status information is provided:
`Active connections`
The current number of active client connections
including `Waiting` connections.
`accepts`
The total number of accepted client connections.
`handled`
The total number of handled connections.
Generally, the parameter value is the same as `accepts`
unless some resource limits have been reached
(for example, the
[worker_connections](/nginx/module-reference/../ngx_core_module#worker_connections) limit).
`requests`
The total number of client requests.
`Reading`
The current number of connections where nginx is reading the request header.
`Writing`
The current number of connections
where nginx is writing the response back to the client.
`Waiting`
The current number of idle client connections waiting for a request.
## Embedded Variables


The `ngx_http_stub_status_module` module
supports the following embedded variables (1.3.14):
`$connections_active`
same as the `Active connections` value;
`$connections_reading`
same as the `Reading` value;
`$connections_writing`
same as the `Writing` value;
`$connections_waiting`
same as the `Waiting` value.
