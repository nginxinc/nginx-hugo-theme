## About
[//]: # "These are Markdown comments to guide you through document structure. Remove them as you go, as well as any unnecessary sections."
[//]: # "Use underscores for _italics_, and double asterisks for **bold**."
[//]: # "Backticks are for `monospace`, used sparingly and reserved mostly for executable names - they can cause formatting problems. Avoid them in tables: use italics instead."

[//]: # "This initial section introduces the product to a reader: give a short 1-2 sentence summary of what the product does and its value to the reader."
[//]: # "Name specific functionality it provides: avoid ambiguous descriptions such as 'enables efficiency', focus on what makes it unique."

This is a compilation of all our shortcodes to show how they look, function, respond, and coded.

## Featured Content
[//]: # "You can add a maximum of three cards: any extra will not display."
[//]: # "One card will take full width page: two will take half width each. Three will stack like an inverse pyramid."
[//]: # "Some examples of content could be the latest release note, the most common install path, and a popular new feature."
