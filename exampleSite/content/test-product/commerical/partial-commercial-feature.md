The sidebar for this item should contain _Partial Commercial_ to signifiy that it requires a commercial subscription
for a part of this page.

For example, a module may have specific features or directives within, that
require a commercial subscription, but the module itself can be used without it.

This is managed by the `nd-commercial-partial: true` in the frontmatter.
