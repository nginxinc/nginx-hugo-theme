[Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) is a free icon library with a permissive license (MIT). We use it for our minimal icon needs in place of FontAwesome in Oldframe.

[Lucide link{{<fe "circle">}}](#)

{{<fe "circle">}} in text.

Here are some icons that are using font-awesome but should be backwards compatible:
<i class="fa-solid fa-check" style="color:green"></i>
<i class="fa fa-circle"></i>
{{<warning>}}
This is a Warning callout. There was previously a bug with **bold text** that we should be aware of and continue to check for. This callout was invoked with the `<warning>` shortcode. It has no custom title. {{<fe "octagon-alert">}}
