Lists follow standard [markdown list](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1) syntax. These examples are to help with theme design testing.

## Ordered Lists

1. First item
1. Second item that should be long enough to wrap onto a new line even on the widest of screens for testing
1. Third item with `inline code`. This item also has a nested, unordered list
    - First item
    - Second item that should be long enough to wrap onto a new line even on the widest of screens for testing
    - Third Item
1. Fourth item

## Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second with `inline code`
- Third item
- Fourth item

## Paragraphs

* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item. 
    
    This is on a new line in markdown.

* And here's the third list item.
